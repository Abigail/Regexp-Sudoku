=head1 NAME

Regexp::Sudoku::Constants - Constants related to Regexp::Sudoku

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Regexp::Sudoku;
 use Regexp::Sudoku::Constants qw [:Houses :Constraints :Diagonals];

 my $sudoku = Regexp::Sudoku:: -> new -> init (
    clues      => "...",
    diagonals  => $MAIN |. $MINOR,
    houses     => $NRC,
    constaints => $ANTI_KING;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports constants to be used to configure Sudoku variants
when using C<< Regexp::Sudoku >>.

All constants are bitmasks based on C<< vec >>. Constants are grouped
based on L<< Exporter >> tags; constants exported by the same tag
can be mixed using the bitwise operators: C<< |. >>, C<< &. >>
and C<< ~. >>.

There are two tags C<< :Constraints >> and
C<< :Diagonals >>. There is also the tag C<< :All >>, which can
be used to import all the constants.

We'll discuss the constants below, grouped by the tag which imports
them. (You can still import each constant individually if you wish
to do so).

=head2 C<< :Diagonals >>

Sudokus with constraints on I<< diagonals >> (the constraint being that
the cells on one or more diagonals should be different) are configured
with the C<< diagonals >> parameter, which takes one or more of the following
constants as argument. 

Note that there are many possible diagonals. For an C<< N x N >> Sudoku,
there are C<< 4 * N - 2 >> possible diagonals; for a standard C<< 9 x 9 >>
Sudoku, this means 34 possible diagonals. 

=over 2

=item C<< $MAIN >>

This is used if the cells on the main diagonal, running from the
top left to the bottom right, are all different. Aliases for 
C<< $MAIN >> and C<< $SUB0 >> and C<< $SUPER0 >>.

=item C<< $MINOR >>

This is used if the cells on the minor diagonal, running from the
bottom left to the top right, are all different. Aliases for 
C<< $MINOR >> and C<< $MINOR_SUB0 >> and C<< $MINOR_SUPER0 >>.

=item C<< $SUPER >>

The super diagonal is the diagonal which runs one cell above (or to the
right) of the main diagonal. This is an alias for C<< $SUPER1 >>.

=item C<< $SUB >>

The sub diagonal is the diagonal which runs one cell below (or to the
left) of the main diagonal. This is an alias for C<< $SUB1 >>.

=item C<< $MINOR_SUPER >>

The minor super diagonal is the diagonal which runs one cell above (or to the
left) of the minor diagonal. This is an alias for C<< $MINOR_SUPER1 >>.

=item C<< $MINOR_SUB >>

The minor sub diagonal is the diagonal which runs one cell below (or to the
right) of the main diagonal. This is an alias for C<< $MINOR_SUB1 >>.

=item C<< $SUPER1 .. $SUPER34 >>

C<< $SUPERM >> is the diagonal which runs parallel to the main diagonal,
C<< M >> cells above it (or to its right).

Note: If we have an C<< N x N >> Sudoku, then if C<< M >= N >>, 
this diagonal lies completely outside the Sudoku, and won't make any sense.
If C<< M == N - 1 >> the diagonal only contains a single cell (the one in
the top right corner), and will not contain any other cells to differ from.
For a standard C<< 9 x 9 >> Sudoku, the diagonals C<< $SUPER7 >>
and C<< $SUPER6 >> lie completely in the top right box, and hence, 
don't impose any additional constraints.

=item C<< $SUB1 .. $SUB34 >>

C<< $SUBM >> is the diagonal which runs parallel to the main diagonal,
C<< M >> cells below it (or to its left).

The Note above applies here as well.

=item C<< $MINOR_SUPER1 .. $MINOR_SUPER34 >>

C<< $MINOR_SUPERM >> is the diagonal which runs parallel to the minor diagonal,
C<< M >> cells above it (or to its left).

The Note above applies here as well.

=item C<< $MINOR_SUB1 .. $MINOR_SUB34 >>

C<< $MINOR_SUBM >> is the diagonal which runs parallel to the minor diagonal,
C<< M >> cells below it (or to its right).

The Note above applies here as well.

=item C<< $CROSS >>

This is a mask oring C<< $MAIN >> and C<< $MINOR >> together
(C<< $CROSS = $MAIN |. $MINOR >>). This is used to indicate cells
on both the main and minor diagonals should differ. This is a common
Sudoku variant, the I<< X-Sudoku >>. 

=item C<< $CROSS1 .. $CROSS34 >>

Each of those masks ors together the super, sub, minor super and minor sub
diagonals C<< M >> steps (for C<< $CROSSM >>) above/below the main and
minor diagonals. So, each C<< $CROSSM >> mask implies uniqueness 
constraints on four diagonals.

=item C<< $DOUBLE >>

This is an alias for C<< $CROSS1 >>, and is used for a Sudoku variant
where all the cells on the diagonals just next to the main and minor
diagonals should be unique.

=item C<< $TRIPLE >>

This mask combines C<< $CROSS >> and C<< $CROSS1 >> 
(C<< $TRIPLE = $CROSS |. $CROSS1 >>). This is used for the variant
where the cells on the six largest diagonals (the main and minor
diagonals, and the four right next to them) should be unique.

=item C<< $ARGYLE >>

This mask combines C<< $CROSS1 >> and C<< $CROSS4 >> and is used
for the I<< Argyle Sudoku >> variant. The eight diagonals of this
mask form a pattern known as an I<< argyle >> pattern.
